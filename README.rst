Yet another python client for
`tldr <https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr>`__.

Intro
-----

tldr.py is a python client for
`tldr <https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr>`__: simplified and
community-driven man pages. Instead of the long man pages:

tldr will give you several simple yet powerful examples:

The command examples are not good? Don't worry, you can set up your own
'tldr'! They are just markdown files and you can modify them at your
ease. Don't forget to Share them with the community!

One more thing, tldr is just a simple version for the man page, it's
**NOT** an alternative. Sometimes, you should read the man pages
patiently ;)

Features highlight
------------------

-  use local file, fast.
-  support custom the output color.
-  support fetch the latest tldr pages.
-  support rebuild the index.

Install
-------

::

    $ (sudo) pip install tldr.py

Usage
-----

Initialize
~~~~~~~~~~

-  firstly, clone the tldr repo to somewhere(e.g. ~/code/tldr). We will
   use it when we look for a command usage.

   ::

       $ cd ~/code
       $ git clone https://github.com/lord63/tldr.py.git

-  then, init the configuration file, the default location for the
   configuration file is your home directory, you can use the
   ``TLDR_CONFIG_DIR`` environment variable to point it to another
   folder(e.g. $HOME/.config)

   ::

       $ tldr init
       Input the tldr repo path(absolute path): (e.g. /home/lord63/code/tldr/)
       Input your platform(linux, osx or sunos): (e.g. linux)
       Initializing the config file at ~/.tldrrc

and you configuration file should look like this:

::

    colors:
       command: cyan
       description: blue
       usage: green
    platform: linux
    repo_directory: /home/lord63/code/tldr

Don't worry about the ``colors`` option, it is for the output when you
look for a command, you can custom it by yourself.(Note that the color
should be in ['black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta',
'cyan', 'white'])

-  finally, build the index. Tldr.py will find the command via the
   index.json. After a new fresh clone or when you add some new pages,
   remember to rebuild the index.

   ::

       $ tldr reindex
       Rebuild the index.

Use tldr
~~~~~~~~

look for a command usage:

::

    $ tldr find {{command}}

check for updates(so that we can get the latest man pages):

::

    $ tldr update

rebuild the index.json after you add some new pages:

::

    $ tldr reindex

locate the command man page:

::

    $ tldr locate {{command}}

Or you can use ``tldr --help`` to get the help message.

FAQ
---

    Q: I want to add some custom command usages to a command, how to do
    it?

A: Find the location of the command page; add the command usages; done.

    Q: I want to add some custom command pages, how?

A: Add the command pages to the right folder(e.g. /tldrrepo/pages/linux);
rebuild the index; done.

    Q: I don't like the default color theme, how to change it?

A: Edit the tldr configuration file at ``~/.tldrrc``; modify the color
until you're happy with it.

    Q: I faided to update the tldr pages, why?

A: Actually, ``tldr.py`` just tries to pull the latest tldr pages for
you, no magic behinds it. So the reason why you faided to update is that
``tldr.py`` failed to pull the latest upstream, check the failing output
and you may know the reason, e.g. you make some changes and haven't
commit them yet. You can pull the pages by hand so you can have a better
control on it.

    Q: Why use the git repo instead of the assets packaged by the
    official?

A: In fact, you can use the offical assets if you want, download the
assets and extract it somewhere, but ``tldr.py`` don't support update it
using ``tldr update``.

Use a git repo, you can:

-  do the version control, yeah, use git.
-  better for customization, just edit the pages and add new pages, they
   belongs to you. You can even maintain your own 'tldr'. If use the
   official assets, you'll always get the latest pages.
